        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            Nephrology:
Research published in BMC Nephrology focused on developing a nomogram model to predict delayed graft function (DGF) in deceased donor kidney transplantation based on pre-transplant biopsies. This model aims to improve preoperative predictions and outcomes for kidney transplant recipients (BioMed Central).

          </li>
          <li>Breast Cancer Research:
            A study published in Breast Cancer Research investigated the use of 99m Tc-NM-02 nanobody for detecting HER2 expression in breast cancer patients. This novel imaging probe demonstrated high affinity and specificity for HER2, offering a promising tool for non-invasive cancer diagnostics (BioMed Central).
            </li>
            <li>Cardiology:
              The SELECT trial, published in the American College of Cardiology, explored the effects of semaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes in overweight or obese adults without diabetes but with established cardiovascular disease. The study found that semaglutide reduced cardiovascular events by 20%, marking a significant advance in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions in this demographic (American College of Cardiology).

          <li>ICCSM 2023 (International Conference on Computer Science and Mechatronics):
            This conference took place from March 10-12, 2023, in Shanghai, China. However, its proceedings include contributions from researchers worldwide, including Tanzania. The focus was on the interaction between computer science and mechatronics, covering topics such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and control systems (AIP Publishing Print on Demand).
            </li>
            <li>ECCSIT 2023 (Eurasian Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology):
              Held virtually from December 15-17, 2023, this conference was organized by several academic institutions and organizations, providing a platform for researchers from around the world, including those from Tanzania, to present their work. Topics included artificial intelligence, distributed systems, high-performance computing, and more (ECCSIT).

          <li>Turing Machines .This chapter introduces the concept of Turing machines, which are fundamental to the theory of computation. It explains how these abstract machines can simulate any computer algorithm, forming the basis for understanding what can be computed.</li>

       
        <li>Solving Problems by Searching .This chapter covers fundamental concepts and algorithms in artificial intelligence related to search problems, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A* search. It provides a solid foundation for understanding how intelligent agents solve problems by searching through possible solutions.
